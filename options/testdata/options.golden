USAGE:
  envbuilder

OPTIONS:
      --base-image-cache-dir string, $ENVBUILDER_BASE_IMAGE_CACHE_DIR
          The path to a directory where the base image can be found. This should
          be a read-only directory solely mounted for the purpose of caching the
          base image.

      --build-context-path string, $ENVBUILDER_BUILD_CONTEXT_PATH
          Can be specified when a DockerfilePath is specified outside the base
          WorkspaceFolder. This path MUST be relative to the WorkspaceFolder
          path into which the repo is cloned.

      --build-secrets string-array, $ENVBUILDER_BUILD_SECRETS
          The list of secret environment variables to use when building the
          image.

      --cache-repo string, $ENVBUILDER_CACHE_REPO
          The name of the container registry to push the cache image to. If this
          is empty, the cache will not be pushed.

      --cache-ttl-days int, $ENVBUILDER_CACHE_TTL_DAYS
          The number of days to use cached layers before expiring them. Defaults
          to 7 days.

      --coder-agent-subsystem string-array, $CODER_AGENT_SUBSYSTEM
          Coder agent subsystems to report when forwarding logs. The envbuilder
          subsystem is always included.

      --coder-agent-token string, $CODER_AGENT_TOKEN
          Authentication token for a Coder agent. If this is set, then
          CODER_AGENT_URL must also be set.

      --coder-agent-url string, $CODER_AGENT_URL
          URL of the Coder deployment. If CODER_AGENT_TOKEN is also set, logs
          from envbuilder will be forwarded here and will be visible in the
          workspace build logs.

      --devcontainer-dir string, $ENVBUILDER_DEVCONTAINER_DIR
          The path to the folder containing the devcontainer.json file that will
          be used to build the workspace and can either be an absolute path or a
          path relative to the workspace folder. If not provided, defaults to
          `.devcontainer`.

      --devcontainer-json-path string, $ENVBUILDER_DEVCONTAINER_JSON_PATH
          The path to a devcontainer.json file that is either an absolute path
          or a path relative to DevcontainerDir. This can be used in cases where
          one wants to substitute an edited devcontainer.json file for the one
          that exists in the repo.

      --docker-config-base64 string, $ENVBUILDER_DOCKER_CONFIG_BASE64
          The base64 encoded Docker config file that will be used to pull images
          from private container registries. When this is set, Docker
          configuration set via the DOCKER_CONFIG environment variable is
          ignored.

      --dockerfile-path string, $ENVBUILDER_DOCKERFILE_PATH
          The relative path to the Dockerfile that will be used to build the
          workspace. This is an alternative to using a devcontainer that some
          might find simpler.

      --exit-on-build-failure bool, $ENVBUILDER_EXIT_ON_BUILD_FAILURE
          Terminates the container upon a build failure. This is handy when
          preferring the FALLBACK_IMAGE in cases where no devcontainer.json or
          image is provided. However, it ensures that the container stops if the
          build process encounters an error.

      --export-env-file string, $ENVBUILDER_EXPORT_ENV_FILE
          Optional file path to a .env file where envbuilder will dump
          environment variables from devcontainer.json and the built container
          image.

      --fallback-image string, $ENVBUILDER_FALLBACK_IMAGE
          Specifies an alternative image to use when neither an image is
          declared in the devcontainer.json file nor a Dockerfile is present. If
          there's a build failure (from a faulty Dockerfile) or a
          misconfiguration, this image will be the substitute. Set
          ExitOnBuildFailure to true to halt the container if the build faces an
          issue.

      --force-safe bool, $ENVBUILDER_FORCE_SAFE
          Ignores any filesystem safety checks. This could cause serious harm to
          your system! This is used in cases where bypass is needed to unblock
          customers.

      --get-cached-image bool, $ENVBUILDER_GET_CACHED_IMAGE
          Print the digest of the cached image, if available. Exits with an
          error if not found.

      --git-clone-depth int, $ENVBUILDER_GIT_CLONE_DEPTH
          The depth to use when cloning the Git repository.

      --git-clone-single-branch bool, $ENVBUILDER_GIT_CLONE_SINGLE_BRANCH
          Clone only a single branch of the Git repository.

      --git-http-proxy-url string, $ENVBUILDER_GIT_HTTP_PROXY_URL
          The URL for the HTTP proxy. This is optional.

      --git-password string, $ENVBUILDER_GIT_PASSWORD
          The password to use for Git authentication. This is optional.

      --git-ssh-private-key-base64 string, $ENVBUILDER_GIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64
          Base64 encoded SSH private key to be used for Git authentication. If
          this is set, then GIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH cannot be set.

      --git-ssh-private-key-path string, $ENVBUILDER_GIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
          Path to an SSH private key to be used for Git authentication. If this
          is set, then GIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64 cannot be set.

      --git-url string, $ENVBUILDER_GIT_URL
          The URL of a Git repository containing a Devcontainer or Docker image
          to clone. This is optional.

      --git-username string, $ENVBUILDER_GIT_USERNAME
          The username to use for Git authentication. This is optional.

      --ignore-paths string-array, $ENVBUILDER_IGNORE_PATHS
          The comma separated list of paths to ignore when building the
          workspace.

      --init-args string, $ENVBUILDER_INIT_ARGS
          The arguments to pass to the init command. They are split according to
          /bin/sh rules with https://github.com/kballard/go-shellquote.

      --init-command string, $ENVBUILDER_INIT_COMMAND
          The command to run to initialize the workspace. Default: `/bin/sh`.

      --init-script string, $ENVBUILDER_INIT_SCRIPT
          The script to run to initialize the workspace. Default: `sleep
          infinity`.

      --insecure bool, $ENVBUILDER_INSECURE
          Bypass TLS verification when cloning and pulling from container
          registries.

      --layer-cache-dir string, $ENVBUILDER_LAYER_CACHE_DIR
          The path to a directory where built layers will be stored. This spawns
          an in-memory registry to serve the layers from.

      --post-start-script-path string, $ENVBUILDER_POST_START_SCRIPT_PATH
          The path to a script that will be created by envbuilder based on the
          postStartCommand in devcontainer.json, if any is specified (otherwise
          the script is not created). If this is set, the specified InitCommand
          should check for the presence of this script and execute it after
          successful startup.

      --push-image bool, $ENVBUILDER_PUSH_IMAGE
          Push the built image to a remote registry. This option forces a
          reproducible build.

      --remote-repo-build-mode bool, $ENVBUILDER_REMOTE_REPO_BUILD_MODE (default: false)
          Use the remote repository as the source of truth when building the
          image. Enabling this option ignores user changes to local files and
          they will not be reflected in the image. This can be used to improving
          cache utilization when multiple users are building working on the same
          repository.

      --setup-script string, $ENVBUILDER_SETUP_SCRIPT
          The script to run before the init script. It runs as the root user
          regardless of the user specified in the devcontainer.json file.
          SetupScript is ran as the root user prior to the init script. It is
          used to configure envbuilder dynamically during the runtime. e.g.
          specifying whether to start systemd or tiny init for PID 1.

      --skip-rebuild bool, $ENVBUILDER_SKIP_REBUILD
          Skip building if the MagicFile exists. This is used to skip building
          when a container is restarting. e.g. docker stop -> docker start This
          value can always be set to true - even if the container is being
          started for the first time.

      --ssl-cert-base64 string, $ENVBUILDER_SSL_CERT_BASE64
          The content of an SSL cert file. This is useful for self-signed
          certificates.

      --verbose bool, $ENVBUILDER_VERBOSE
          Enable verbose logging.

      --workspace-base-dir string, $ENVBUILDER_WORKSPACE_BASE_DIR (default: /workspaces)
          The path under which workspaces will be placed when workspace folder
          option is not given.

      --workspace-folder string, $ENVBUILDER_WORKSPACE_FOLDER
          The path to the workspace folder that will be built. This is optional.
          Defaults to `[workspace base dir]/[name]` where name is the name of
          the repository or `empty`.
