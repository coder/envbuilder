// Package notcodersdk contains manually-vendored code from
// github.com/coder/coder/v2/codersdk.
//
// This code is currently required for sending workspace build logs to
// coder. It was manually vendored to avoid dependency issues.
//
// If the direct integration is moved outside of envbuilder,
// this package can safely be removed.
// See the below issues for context:
// - https://github.com/coder/envbuilder/issues/178
